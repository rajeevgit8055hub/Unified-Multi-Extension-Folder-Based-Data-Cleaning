## ðŸ“– Project Overview  

This project focused on managing a **complex data cleaning and consolidation process** involving **multiple file formats** â€”  
`.csv`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, and `.accdb`.  

All files were located in a **master folder**, containing **disorganized data** from different **years** and **work shifts**.  
The raw data suffered from **inconsistent naming conventions**, **varied structures**, and **format-specific challenges**.  

The **primary goal** was to design and implement an **automated process** to import, transform, and clean all files,  
finally producing a **single, unified, and well-structured Excel workbook** ready for analysis.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives  

- Automate the **import and consolidation** of mixed-format files.  
- Apply **format-specific cleaning techniques** for each file type.  
- Standardize and **normalize datasets** for consistency.  
- Organize final cleaned outputs into **clear, logical sections**.  
- Build a **scalable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process** for future data updates.

## âš™ Approach & Execution  

### **1. Folder-Based Import Automation**  
- Used **Power Queryâ€™s Folder Connector** to automatically import **all files** from the master folder in one go.  
- Ensured the process can **refresh automatically** when new files are added.  

### **2. File Extension-Specific Processing**  
- Created **duplicate queries** for each file extension (`.csv`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, `.accdb`).  
- Filtered files by extension to **apply unique cleaning logic** to each type.  

### **3. Dynamic Transformation Logic**  
- Applied **Invoke Custom Function** to dynamically expand and transform files without manual intervention.  

### **4. Handling Complex Formats**  
- Developed **custom logic** for `.pdf` and `.accdb` files due to their non-tabular structures.  
- Extracted tables from PDFs and imported Access tables into Power Query for further transformation.  

### **5. Data Cleaning & Standardization**  
- Standardized **column names** for uniformity.  
- Applied **correct data types** (text, number, date).  
- Fixed **formatting issues**, removed extra spaces, and replaced invalid values.  
- Applied **error handling** to ensure clean outputs.  

### **6. Organized Final Output**  
- Loaded cleaned data into **separate worksheets** within a single Excel workbook, organized **by file type**.

## ðŸ§  Key Skills Demonstrated  

- **Folder-Based Automation:** Batch import and refresh of mixed-format files using Power Queryâ€™s folder connector.  
- **Query Duplication & Filtering:** Extension-wise data processing with dedicated queries for `.csv`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, and `.accdb`.  
- **Advanced Data Extraction:** Dynamic parsing and expansion of nested or complex data using Invoke Custom Function.  
- **Format-Specific Solutions:** Custom Power Query steps to handle non-standard `.pdf` and Access database formats.  
- **Data Cleaning & Standardization:** Applied splitting, trimming, error handling, and consistent formatting techniques.  
- **Structured Loading:** Organized clean datasets in separate sheets within a single Excel workbook.  
- **Scalable ETL Workflow:** Built a reusable and scalable process to accommodate ongoing data updates and multiple formats.
